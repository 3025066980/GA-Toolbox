The toolbox was written with the\r\nsupport of a UK SERC grant, and the final version (v1.2) was\r\ncompleted in 1994.\r\n\r\nThe Toolbox was originally developed for MATLAB v4.2. It has also\r\nbeen successfully used with subsequent versions up to and including\r\nMATLAB 7.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed introduction to the capabilities and use of the \r\nGA Toolbox, please refer to the two introductory papers and the\r\nToolbox User's Guide, all of which are available at the GA Toolbox\r\nhomepage at http://codem.group.shef.ac.uk/index.php/ga-toolbox.\r\n\r\nThe GA Toolbox is copyrighted by the original authors and The University \r\nof Sheffield, and is published here under the GNU General Public \r\nLicense. (See http://www.fsf.org/licenses/licenses.html)\r\n\r\nWe would be interested to hear of your experiences with, criticisms \r\nof, and enhancements to, the GA Toolbox. Please direct all such\r\ncorrespondence to ga-toolbox@acse.sheffield.ac.uk.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n",
